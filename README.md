# XMLViewer

## XMLViewer is a visual XML viewer that intuitively views XMLElements using an outline view, and it has been adapted for OpenOfficeXML (OOXML), allowing you to open OOXML files with one click and preview all the XML inside. We have added index displays for sibling elements and attributes, which can help you quickly process OOXML.
